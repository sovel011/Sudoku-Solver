# sudoku-solver

Demo API for learning Kotlin by solving Sudoku puzzles - **Still a WIP.**

End goal is that clients will be able to call the API by providing an inital state of a Sudoku grid, and the API will return either the solved grid, or a response indicating that no solution exists. I also plan to implement several different algorithms for finding a solution including Brute force, a probabilistic method such as [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), or a [Pencil-and-Paper](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/meerkamp/Site/Solving_any_Sudoku_II.html) method.
